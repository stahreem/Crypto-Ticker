# üöÄ Crypto Ticker Dashboard

This project is a Crypto Ticker Dashboard that displays cryptocurrency prices, buy/sell prices, and volume, inspired by the HODLINFO layout. It utilizes a Node.js/Express backend to fetch and store data from the WazirX API, and a frontend built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to display the data in a visually appealing, responsive UI.
